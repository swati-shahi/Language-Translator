# Language-Translator
This is a desktop-based tool designed to facilitate translation of text from one language to another. The goal of this project is to enable users to input text in any language, translate it to a selected target language, and hear the translated text spoken aloud.


# Objectives :-
1) Translation Functionality: The application provides text translation between any two selected languages.

2) Text-to-Speech: It converts the translated text into speech for better accessibility and ease of understanding.

3) User-Friendly Interface: The app offers a simple GUI where users can easily input text, select source and target languages, and get the translation and audio output.


# Features :-
1) Text Translation: Users can input text and translate it to their desired language.

2) Language Selection: A drop-down menu allows users to select the source and target languages from a list of available languages.

3) Text-to-Speech (TTS): After translating the text, the app uses gTTS to generate speech from the translated text and plays it using the default audio player on the system.

4) Error Handling: If an unsupported language is selected or if any errors occur during translation, a message is displayed to inform the user.

# Technologies Used :-
1) Python: The core programming language used to develop the application.

2) Tkinter: The library used to build the GUI.

3) googletrans: The library that interfaces with the Google Translate API to perform translations.

4) gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): Converts translated text to speech.

5) os: Used for interacting with the operating system, particularly for playing the audio file generated by gTTS.
